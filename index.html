            <p>I am a computer science major. I am hoping to find a job where I can work from home because I want to live remote, but still make enough money to have a good lifestyle. When I am not at school I really enjoy doing art, watercolor painting and mixed media is my favorite. I also like spending time with my cat Mia. I got my her last month from the Snake River Animal Shelter and she is like my bestfriend not because I have no friends but because I'm a crazy cat lady. I also enjoy going on walks and being outside with my friends and I have a big rock collection. </p>
