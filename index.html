                <p>Thank's for trying to help get my siblings out of my mom's house. I know you didn't just do it for me but I was really worried about them all year last year and I really like knowing that as for right now, they are safe.</p>

                <p>Thank you for paying for my college, rent, phone bill, and doctors appointments. I know I don’t do a good job showing it, but I really do appreciate it it means a lot to me it’s nice when I go grocery shopping I can afford to buy the food I like and I don’t have to go hungry like a lot of people my age.</p>

                <p>Thank you for being patient with me while I'm working on getting myself put back together again after everything. Even though I’m not completely back to normal I have made a lot of progress. I only have anxiety attacks around once every month or two instead of three times a week. I can eat whatever I want now and I don't feel shameful about it and I don't think I look fat in every picture I’m in. I don't shake and cry when my phone rings or a white honda pilot drives past me anymore. I learned healthier coping mechanisms, so I only make myself throw up or cut myself only once every four months instead of four times a week. Even though I'm not completely back to normal I have made a lot of progress I thought maybe you would want to hear what all I've improved on.</p>

                <p>Thanks again for everything you do, I don't know what I'd do without you. I'm glad you're my dad and that you were there for me right after I moved out. It's crazy that you are running a business; taking care of my little siblings; and dealing with my mom all at once I didn't know it was even possible for someone to do that all at once, but here you are. I love you, if you need anything from me let me know. Happy Father's Day</p>
