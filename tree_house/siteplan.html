      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I changed my mind for my old idea becauseI realized it was going to be hard for me to create a website that looks good and is organized. Instead I am doing a website for almost a campsite, but people rent out treehouses to stay in. I choose to do this for my assignment because I know I will be able to make it look good and it’s something that I will enjoy doing. I was able to find some pictures I really liked to use for this assignment. The homepage is just going to be for advertisement, I will write a paragraph saying how important customer satisfaction is to my business and have a few five star reviews on my page. For the second page I am going to show my different treehouses that I am going to be renting out complete with a description and how much it costs to rent per night. On the final page I am going to write about what other benefits come from renting our treehouses, I’m going to say that there is a lake and hiking trails nearby; each treehouse has a fireplace, free wifi, heating, and plumbing; and I am also going to say that there is a hot tub.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be people planning a vacation and want to do something where they can be outdoors and by nature, but they don’t really want to go camping</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Why my site?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I love being outdoors and being surrounded by nature, however I don’t really like camping that much because I like being able to shower and stay clean. I decided to make a website for a place you can rent out a treehouse for a couple of nights at a place in the middle of the woods that’s almost like a campsite, but you still have a shower, heat, and a kitchen. I think it would be fun to rent out a treehouse for a few nights with my friends and I am sure many other people would think so too. Especially with people like me who like the outdoors but aren’t the biggest fan of camping.

      <h3>
        What to Expect
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        My site is going to have the home page be advertising my fake business and show some good reviews and also a paragraph on how my business prioritizes customer satisfaction. The second page is going to show pictures of the different treehouses and how much it costs a night for each one and a brief description of each treehouse. The last page is going to show what all is included when you stay at the treehouses.
