    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I am making this website because I need to get a good grade in this class and I can't fall behind so early in the semester. I need to pass this class in order to get my degree and if I don't do this assignment I am going to be lost the rest of the semester. I am hoping I can make this website look good. I want it to be simple, with a dark grey background and white text and I want to have some pops of green, blue, and red.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>I am trying to target upper class women who live in Jackson because they have a lot of money, and they would be easy to advertise to. They want to make plans in order to spend time with their family and post about how great they are. I will show photos of families going rafting and make sure the moms are very hot because the type of people I am advertising to are very materialistic and if they see beautiful women going rafting, they will want to fo rafting. They will most likly access my site form a lap top.</p>
